This is a new series of posts I'm calling "Pointless Rage," where I get angry about shit I can't change. I hope someone reads these and feels better about themselves for it.

Education
---------

Education is a topic near and dear to my heart. For a long time, in school was the only place I felt comfortable. I got to college and that changed. Part of the reason is I discovered I suffered from [Dysthymia][dys], the other part is that I realized I'd been lied to as to the way education works here in the US.

There's a leitmotif in education that you may not have heard in your education, and it is "it'll get better." My guidance counselor, when I told him my classes were boring and uninteresting, claimed since middle school that I'd get to pick my classes next year, and that they'd be more interesting and engaging. He lied. I still had to put up with bullshit classes. I took refuge in the belief that in college, I'd *really* get to specialize my classes and not put up with things I didn't want to do.
