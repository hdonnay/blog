I've been doing some home network improvements, namely upgrading it to
dual IP v4/v6. The benefit that convinced me was www.he.net giving out a
free /48, which would allow me to access one Internet's worth of
machines from behind a single public IPv4. The current state of home
networking is a sad, sad affair where you get one multiply NAT'ed IP
address. The fine print says you need to pay up for an IP for every
machine behind the modem, but c'mon. No one does this.

And so, as of this writing, I have a website (this one), a mailserver,
some assorted daemons, and and all my machines accessable via IPv6 only.

The process was acutally mad easy, because HE's documentation, while
spartan, works really well. The main stumbling block I had was not
assigning my NIC an IP address. In hindsight, this seems obvious, but
seeing as how my setup (a single NIC IPv6 gateway) isn't exactly common, I can forgive that it's not spelled out anywhere.

The mailserver (postfix) is being a pain in the ass, but I think that's
to be expected.
