This is a new series of posts I'm calling "Pointless Rage," where I get
angry about shit I can't change. I hope someone reads these and feels
better about themselves for it.

Education
---------

Education is a topic near and dear to my heart. For a long time, in
school was the only place I felt comfortable. I got to college and that
changed. Part of the reason is I discovered I suffered from
[Dysthymia][dys], the other part is that I realized I'd been lied to as
to the way education works here in the US.

There's a leitmotif in education that you may not have heard in your
education, and it is "it'll get better." My guidance counselor, when I
told him my classes were boring and uninteresting, claimed since middle
school that I'd get to pick my classes next year, and that they'd be
more interesting and engaging. He lied. I still had to put up with
bullshit classes. I took refuge in the belief that in college, I'd
*really* get to specialize my classes and not put up with things I
didn't want to do.

Yet here I am balls deep into college, and still doing things I have no
interest in doing.

It's even more frustrating that I have a job doing what I'd like to do,
and I like to think I'm good at it, and it seemingly counts for nothing.
I need a piece of paper to say that, and it sucks.
